Pagination is a UI component that allows users to navigate through pages and change page size at runtime.

This tutorial explains how to add Pagination to a page and configure the component's core settings. It also covers implementing remote pagination. Colored cards are loaded each time a user switches pages or changes page size. The final result is displayed below:

<div class="simulator-desktop-container" data-view="/Content/Applications/25_1/GettingStartedWith/Pagination/index.html, /Content/Applications/25_1/GettingStartedWith/Pagination/index.js, /Content/Applications/25_1/GettingStartedWith/Pagination/index.css"></div>

Each section in this tutorial describes a single configuration step. You can also find the full source code in the following GitHub repository:
